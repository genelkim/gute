# GUTE: Gene Louis Kim's Lisp Utilities.

Gene's Utilities, a cute personal library of functions in Common Lisp. File IO,
string manipulation, etc. As I do research in reasoning with language the code
is oriented towards processing grammatical attributes of English and
manipulating tree structures. 

Much of the code is copied over (and refactored) from the Lore project by
Jonathan Gordon and Benjamin Van Durme. The files are named to reflect the
content inside. Please read the comments in the files to get the details.

You can add an issue or contact me at <genekim@usf.edu> to report bugs.
