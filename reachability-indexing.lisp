  "The graph G is given as a list of vertices, where vertices are
   atoms with properties named by IN and OUT. The values corresponding
   to these properties are lists of vertices from which edges are
   incident, and to which they are directed, respectively. IN and OUT
   are pre-existing properties, while INDS, INTS, and VIS are created
   in this program. VIS IN, OUT, INDS, INTS, VIS are all *names* of
   atoms to be used as indicators, not the indicator atoms themselves.

   The result is that all vertices have properties named INDS and INTS
   (indices and intervals), such that vertex m is a proper ancestor of
   n iff some index in the INDS list of n is contained in some interval
   in the INTS list of m. Intervals are represented as dotted pairs of
   positive integers, e.g., an INTS list might be ((1 . 3) (5 . 5) (8 . 9)).
